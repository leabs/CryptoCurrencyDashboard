      This dashboard outputs static html for a fast and secure connection using

      I made this dashboard because the whole conversation about crypto currency
      facinates me. The idea that people can buy into a construct like crypto
      and decide it has inherent value is wild, as are the stories of those who
      bought in early to become millionaires, or those who have coins in cold
      storage and forgot the password to their vault.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I have purchased a small amount, as well as started to mine with my home
      pc in an effort to have some small seat on this wild ride.
